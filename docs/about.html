        <p>
          From the time I started learning my first programming language my Sophmore year of high school I had a goal of becoming a
          software developer. I started with C++ and was only able to keep up with it until life happened and I stopped my pursuit
          of learning core concepts of programming. Fast forward from to 2017, I needed a change and so I picked up programming again
          but with Java this time. I enrolled at Salt Lake Community College and finished all of the core classes for both the Web
          Development Certificate of Proficiency(Dec 2018) and then the Software Development Certificate of Proficiency(May 2019).
          During this time I utilized as many resources as possible to learn like Udemy and Pluralsight. I got into building my own
          projects and quickly gear towards Javascript. I began making API's with Node.js and started building some MEAN Stack Apps
          to become more familiar with Web Development as a whole. I also tried my hand in the Microsoft Stack where I had built a
          Ledger App using ASP.NET MVC and MSSQL. I also adated the ledger app in Java as part of my Final group project for one of
          my college courses. Today, I consider myself more of a Javascript Full Stack Developer and a skilled SQL Administrator.
          But I love programming and will always strive to be able to adapt what I create to fit whatever programming language I use.

        <p>
          I initally wanted to pursue 2 degrees from Salt Lake Community College. First was an Applied Science Technical degree for
          automotive that I ended up having to drop out of due to other events happening in my life at that time. The current
          degree I am pursuing is an Associate Computer Science degree. I can only attend school part-time and have only
          starting going back again since spring of 2017. Since then I have taken mostly courses related to the certificates
          related to my area of study (Web Development and Software Development). I also started teaching myself the basics
          of most everything related to the courses I've taken prior to attending so I was fairly advanced in almost all
          of my classes compared to the other students. I even helped the teachers in explaining complex concepts and provided
          individual tutoring to other classmates when I was finished with my own work done in class. I was the team leader
          in the final group project in my Object Oriented Programming class and took the lead in design and work flow for
          the final group project for a real client in my Advanced Javascript and Jquery class. I found being the lead on
          projects meant that I could learn from others just as much by teaching and mentoring as I do with all the exploration
          of technology I learn about on a daily basis.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <h4>Personal projects and professional experience</h4>
        <p>
          My very first programming project was in high school using C++. I had built a simple command line banking application and then a small command line game.
          Later, I started learning Java and C#. I made a Ledger application with ASP.NET MVC and MySQL. I started focusing more on front end development and thus 
          began my Javascript journey. Node.js and Angular.js quickly became my learning playground and now most of my personal projects use Node.js for the backend.
          I learned and used more Java at my time attending Salt Lake Community College and shortly after being awarded my Web Development and Softwrae Development
          Certificates from SLCC I got a position as a web developer. In that position I was tasked with building reporting web pages for the company's intranet.
          With little more than what the goal was I built the webpage using ASP.NET WebForms, MS SQL server, and Google Maps API. I also built a street address 
          parser in C# that read in spreadsheets and formatted street addresses for the Google Maps API to consume and provide acurrate pin locations. I then started
          working on the lack of error handling with the intranet and helped brainstorm a technical ticketing system that would display an error page without the
          stacktrace and send the log information to IT for review.

        <h4>What do I know anyway</h4>
        <p>
          It's in my nature to both be efficient in everyting I do and learn and explore various technologies. These are polar oposites
          but I learn concepts and retain the knowledge better by trying to do similar things in different programming languages.
          I am always trying something out, but this is a short list that covers what I have the most experience with.
