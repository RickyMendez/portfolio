        <p>
          It all started when I attended my first programming class in high school. We were taught C++ and I knew that technology was
          where I wanted to be in the future. I wasn't able to continue my studies of programming after graduating from high
          school in 2005 though, and I only got back into it around late 2015 when my life fianlly provided the time it takes
          to learn and relearn concepts and syntax. Instead of going right back to C++ I decided to try JavaSE. I learned
          a lot about the similarities but the configuration for web development was overwhelming at the time. So I hopped
          on over to C# and ASP.NET to build my first web app. Aside from the technical aspects I do have other valuable
          skills like problem solving, critical thinking, good communication, and ambition to learn and help others learn.

        <h6>Associates of Computer Science - In Progress</h6>
        <p>
          I initally wanted to pursue 2 degrees from Salt Lake Community College. First was an Applied Science Technical degree for
          automotive that I ended up having to drop out of due to other events happening in my life at that time. The current
          degree I am pursuing is an Associate Computer Science degree. I can only attend school part-time and have only
          starting going back again since spring of 2017. Since then I have taken mostly courses related to the certificates
          related to my area of study (Web Development and Software Development). I also started teaching myself the basics
          of most everything related to the courses I've taken prior to attending so I was fairly advanced in almost all
          of my classes compared to the other students. I even helped the teachers in explaining complex concepts and provided
          individual tutoring to other classmates when I was finished with my own work done in class. I was the team leader
          in the final group project in my Object Oriented Programming class and took the lead in design and work flow for
          the final group project for a real client in my Advanced Javascript and Jquery class. I found being the lead on
          projects meant that I could learn from others just as much by teaching and mentoring as I do with all the exploration
          of technology I learn about on a daily basis.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <h6>From personal projects to real clients</h6>
        <p>
          My interest in programming began in high school where they taught us C++. I knew then that programming was what I wanted
          to do moving forward in life. While I only got back into programming again in late 2015 I could still remeber some
          of the basics that I learned from the past. I studied some Java and quickly jumped into ASP.NET soon after just
          because of the speed of getting started. C# was a little more familiar, so getting started was easy and I began
          to build my first application for my wife. It's a finacial application that I spent many hours building and rebuilind
          from scratch just to help me learn full stack web development concepts. And aside from the actual programming/development
          that I do, I have a knack for problem solving that I've strongly developed working in the automotive industry as
          a technician. Up to this point I have started a few more projects including this website and building and maintaining
          the website for Lancer Automotive Inc, my current employer as of writing this.

        <h6>What do I know anyway</h6>
        <p>
          It's in my nature to both be efficient in everyting I do and learn and explore various technologies. These are polar oposites
          but I learn concepts and retain the knowledge better by trying to do similar things in different programming languages.
          I am always trying something out, but this is a short list that covers what I have the most experience with.
